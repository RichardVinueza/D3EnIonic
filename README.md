### Prerequisites

Before starting you need some background in Ionic and D3. Check the links bellow to get started with Ionic and D3.

To install this project you need a working ionic environment.

### Installing

Open a command line console and clone this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/D3EnIonic
```

Go to the new created directory

```
cd D3EnIonic
```

Test the project

```
ionic serve
```

When all node.js modules have been installed a new browser window will open and you will see a graph with some data and if you click on it you'll get a line which will move anytime you click on it again.
